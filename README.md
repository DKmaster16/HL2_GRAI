New dynamic ammo balancing.
Random NPC height (model scale).
Enemy accuracy increase on higher difficulties.
Enemy speed increase on higher difficulties.
Combine soldier squad flank slots.

Combine Prison Guards are stronger than normal soldiers and have access to energy orbs on Diabolical.
Non Elite soldiers use alt fire only once per life.
Combine Shotgunners fire double shot secondary when standing still.
Combine Elites use their energy orbs against any threat
Soldiers hold back when facing multiple enemies.
Jumping humans.
Anticitizen one metrocops can spawn with shotguns.
Anticitizen one metrocops spawn with manhacks.
No sniper laser sights on Diabolical.
Fast zombie attack combos depending on difficulty.
Fixed dropship turret tracking.
Gunship uses belly cannon.
Lower number of health, armor and ammo drops on higher difficulties.
Improved Rebel follow AI.
Humans wear actual body armor! Metrocop armor stops 9mm, buckshot and AR2 fire, Combine soldier armor withstands high ammount of damage.
Weapons got their reworks as well!

Pistol, 357, AR2 and SMG1 have dynamic spread. Crouching or zooming improves accuracy (357 is perfectly accurate as long as you don't jump or sprint). Sprinting degrades accuracy. Jump/air/ladder shooting is inaccurate (except for the pistol).
