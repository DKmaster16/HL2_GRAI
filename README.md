Half-Life 2 Gameplay Rebalance AI + is a mod-patch to the steam version of half life 2, aiming to improve AI, rework gameplay and to add greater challange to the game.

Combine Elites dark energy orbs disintegrate Player and NPCs on all difficulties.
Combine Elites use their dark orbs against any threat
Soldiers hold back when facing multiple enemies.
Jumping humans.
Anticitizen one metrocops can spawn with shotguns.
Anticitizen one metrocops spawn with manhacks.
No sniper laser sights on Diabolical.
Fast zombie attack combos depending on difficulty.
Fixed dropship turrets.
Gunship uses belly cannon.
Lower number of health, armor and ammo drops on higher difficulties.
Improved Rebel follow AI.
Humans wear actual body armor! Metrocop armor stops 9mm, buckshot and AR2 fire, Combine soldier armor withstands high ammount of damage.
Weapons got their reworks as well!

Pistol, 357, AR2 and SMG1 have dynamic spread. Crouching or zooming improves accuracy (357 is perfectly accurate as long as you don't jump or sprint). Sprinting degrades accuracy. Jump/air/ladder shooting is inaccurate (except for the pistol).

Pistol. Fire rate when holding down mouse button is now consistant and firing at steady 200 RPM.
FIrst shot accuracy is improved. Weapon spread increases the more you spam it.
Cycle rate has been nerfed from 0.1 to 0.14, to prevent triple click mouse abuse, which made it fire like a machine gun. Firing faster than cycle rate still fires all the rounds as soon as cycle is finished.
SMG. Fire rate increased from 800 to 952 RPM to mimic a real MP7. Far tighter spread at 3 Degrees instead of 5. Weapon recoil on hard and diabolical difficulty. Magazine capacity reduced to 40.
Revolver. Fire rate increase from 80 to 150 RPM. Recoil slightly decreased. .357 Magnum rounds deal less damage to humans when shot to the body. One shot headshots against any humanoid for the exception of Elites and Poison zombies.
AR2. Accuracy greatly increased. Harsh recoil on hard and diabolical.
Shotgun. Semi-Auto primary fire with far tighter spread. 8 shell capacity, 7 in the tube + 1 in the chamber. Secondary double shot pump action fire with spread size closer to vanilla. 9 pellets instead of 7. Overall damage decreased from 56 per shot to 45. Secondary attack damage slight nerf from 96 to 90.
